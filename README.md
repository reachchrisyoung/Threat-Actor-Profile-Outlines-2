Objective 1: Craft reporting templates based on the given methodology. <br />
<br />
NOTE: For strategic insight on implementing this outline, please refer to the [Threat Actor Profile Methodology](https://github.com/reachchrisyoung/Threat-Actor-Profile-Methodology?tab=readme-ov-file#readme).

<h1>Threat Actor Profile Report to Operational Teams Template</h1>

<h2>Part A) Executive Summary</h2>

Explain the level of threat to the company, which may include (among the following):<br />

Highlight – 

+ Whether [ThreatActorA] has targeted the company’s sector / country / region as early as 
   possible.

Create – 

+ A short assessment of why the company could be targeted (or have been targeted) by 
   [ThreatActorA].

+ A short evaluation of the company’s ability to defend against and mitigate the threat proposed 
   by [ThreatActorA].

<h2>Part B) About [ThreatActorA]</h2>

<h4>Step 1 – [ThreatActorA] Alias Housekeeping</h4>

<h4>Step 2 – Answer the following questions:</h4>

+ What type of threat actor is this (i.e., what group)? 
  NOTE: Consider common labels like cybercrime, espionage, hacktivist, etc.

+ What areas does [ThreatActorA] specialize in?

+ What type of campaign does [ThreatActorA] launch?

+ Assess how advanced [ThreatActorA] is, based on [insert reason(s)].  

+ Outline notable technical observations, such as software and TTPs.

<h2>Part C) Targets of [ThreatActorA]</h2>

+ Which sectors/verticals does [ThreatActorA] target?

  + Think: Proximity to company’s sector / region
  + Think: Recentness of attacks or timeliness applicability

+ What does [ThreatActorA] do once they’re inside a victim’s environment?

+ How long has [ThreatActorA] been known to persist inside a victim’s environment?

+ Are [ThreatActorA]’s targets related to each other?

  + Think: Cyber-enablement campaigns

<h2>Part D) [ThreatActorA] Diamond Model</h2>

Since the Diamond Model Attributes are key details that support rapid understanding of [ThreatActorA]...

<h4>Step 1 – Fill out the Diamond Model Attributes</h4>

<h4>Step 2 – Add the attributes aforementioned to the Diamond Model Diagram</h4>

NOTE: For reference, you can review the Diamond Model Diagram by [clicking here](https://www.activeresponse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/diamond.pdf?adlt=strict).

<h4>Step 3 – Leverage the completed Diamond Model Diagram</h4>
   
+ to introduce [ThreatActorA], and...
+ to address key points from threat data research & extraction.

<h2>Part E) [ThreatActorA] Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)</h2>

<h4>Step 1 – Summarize the technical details of [ThreatActorA] at a high level.</h4>

+ Consider utilizing [Unified Kill Chain](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf)’s 3 Stages: In, Through, & Out

<h4>Step 2 – Address [ThreatActorA]’s TTPs in detail</h4>

+ Recommendation: Utilize the [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/)

+ Recommendation: Create a Table for TTPs (See Sample Table Below)

<h2>Part F) References</h2>

+ All external references desired for inclusion into the report.

+ Quality Check: Review report for in-line citations (to show the information source).

+ Consider highlighting any problematic sources (leading to performing source evaluation).

  + This can be a footnote on the page of the [ThreatActorA] card if there is concern regarding 
      the technical aspects or attribution assessments.

  + Limt reference inclusion to only those important for the intelligence recipient to know about.

<h2>Quality Checks</h2>
